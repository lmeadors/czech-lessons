=== Fifteen (30m) ===

Need one deck of cards for every 3 people.

Start dealing 3 cards - need to get a "set" or a "run": 

* A "set" is three or more cards of the same value in any suit
* A "run" is three or more cards (A-2-3...9-10-J-Q-K-A) in a row of the SAME suit

You have to play ALL of your cards AND have a card to discard to "go out". 

After one player has "gone out", all other players get one more chance to play as much as they can (they do NOT have to play all of their cards). Any cards they have left are added up and the player who had the cards gets that many points added to their score. The goal is to have the lowest score possible.

After playing with 3 cards, you play again with 4, then again with 5, and then 6 - all the way up to 15.

Each hand, one card is "wild" - the number of cards dealt is the card that is wild. If you have 3 cards, then the 3 is wild; if you have 4 cards, the 4 is wild; and so on. Jack is 11, Queen is 12, King is 13, Ace is 14 and Deuce (2) is 15. A wild card can be used as ANYTHING - any number or suit.

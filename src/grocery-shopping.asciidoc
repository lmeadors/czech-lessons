=== Grocery shopping

****************************************************************************
Time estimate: 45 minutes
****************************************************************************

Break into 3 groups - breakfast, lunch, dinner:

* You are going to fix a meal and need to buy...
* Use food picture cards to prepare a written shopping list for each meal.
* Pass lists to another group to do the shopping for the lists from above.
* Shuffle cards and deal them out, then they have to ask for the items on their list.

First team to get all of the items on their list wins a prize...

If we have extra time, we can do a mock meal.
